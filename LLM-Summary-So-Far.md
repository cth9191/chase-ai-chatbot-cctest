## 🔧 Key Functional Components

### Chat Interface (`script.js`)
```javascript
class ChaseAIChatbot {
    constructor() {
        // Auto-connects to n8n webhook on load
        this.webhookUrl = 'https://n8n.srv910413.hstgr.cloud/webhook/...';
        // Handles user input, API calls, response parsing
    }
    
    async sendToWebhook(message) {
        // GET request with query params: ?message=...&user=...&timestamp=...
        // Parses JSON response: data.text
    }
}
```

### Matrix Animation
- Canvas-based falling characters
- Blue color scheme (#00AAFF)
- Background animation behind terminal

### Terminal Commands
- `/help` - Show available commands
- `/status` - Display system status  
- `/clear` - Clear chat window
- `/about` - Version info

- **Git**: Initialized, connected to GitHub
- **Node.js**: Available for npm commands

### Vercel CLI Setup
```bash
# Installed and configured
npm install -g vercel
vercel --token YOUR_TOKEN whoami  # One-time authentication
vercel link --project chase-ai-chatbot-cctest    # ✅ Linked
```

### Automated Deployment Command
```bash
vercel --prod --yes
# Result: Instant deployment to https://chase-ai-chatbot-cctest.vercel.app
```

## 🔄 Development History Context

### Phase 1: Initial Build
- Built basic HTML structure with terminal theme
- Created CSS styling with original green Matrix colors
- Implemented JavaScript chat functionality
- Set up n8n webhook integration

### Phase 2: Theme Customization  
- User requested color change from green to blue
- Systematically updated all CSS color values
- Modified Matrix animation colors in JavaScript
- Maintained all visual effects with new palette

### Phase 3: Integration & Debugging
- Initially configured for POST requests, changed to GET for n8n compatibility
- Debugged response parsing (n8n returns `{text: "..."}` not array format)
- Set up local testing environment with Python server
- Cleaned debug console.log statements for production

### Phase 4: Deployment Automation
- Set up Git repository and GitHub integration
- Configured Vercel project initially via dashboard
- Installed and configured Vercel CLI for automation
- Established single-command deployment pipeline
